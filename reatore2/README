The code "reatore2" converts standard Nek5000 "old.rea" files to a two-file format
comprising:

new.rea
new.re2

(Here, "old" and "new" are session names of the user's choice.)

In the new file format, the .rea file contains the complete set of
job control parameters that does _not_ scale the problem size, while
the .re2 file contains those control parameters that _do_ scale with
problem size (i.e., geometry, curve side information, and boundary 
conditions).

BUILD:

cd to tools/converter and type

   make

USAGE:

To generate the new files, run the exectutable and input two session names:

   reatore2
   new            (enter name of existing std-format .rea file )
   old            (enter desired session name attached to new files)

To run nek5000 after this, be certain to copy or move the "old.map" 
file to "new.map".

Note that genmap does not currently read the new file format.  Thus,
if you don't have a .map file, you must run genmap and enter "old"
for the session name.

Then:

   mv old.map new.map

will provide the file set:  new.rea, new.re2, and new.map, that is
required to run nek5000.

ADVANTAGES:

.Speed:       The .re2 file is in binary and the parallel reader has
              been changed so that only node 0 reads this file.  Example
              savings indicate a reduction from ~30 minutes to ~22 seconds
              for 4096 processors with E=360,000.

.Flexibility: When editing the .rea file to change number of timesteps,
              viscosity, etc., it is much easier for large files to not
              have to load all of the geometry and boundary condition
              information into the editor.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:

.The read format is indicated to Nek5000 by the presence of a negative
 number of elements for the solid/fluid domain.
