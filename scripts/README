This directory contains some short scripts for running
or manipulating nek5000 data files.   A brief description
follows.   Below, "blah" and "blah2" are just example 
file names.

=============
Basic Scripts
=============

nek --- run nek5000 interactively (foreground)

        Usage:     nek blah


nekb -- run nek5000 in the background

        Usage:     nekb blah


nekd -- run nek5000 with gdb. (Most likely you should first
        remake setting "G = -g" in the makenek script, followed
        by "make clean"  then "make blah".)

        Usage:     nekd blah   (puts you into gdb)
                   run         (gdb command)


mvn --  Rename all the relevant nek5000 data files

        Usage:     mvn blah blah2


cpn --  Copy all the relevant nek5000 data files

        Usage:     cpn blah blah2


===============================================
More sophisticated scripts for running with MPI
===============================================

These scripts are a bit more sophisticated and will likely
need to be tailored to each specific system, depending on
the mpi environment.

nekmpi -- run nek5000 interactively using mpirun

nekbmpi -- run nek5000 in background using mpirun

nekqsub -- create a nek5000 command script and submit using qsub
